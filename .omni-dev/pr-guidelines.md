## Overview

A well-written pull request serves multiple purposes:

- **Documentation**: Explains what changed and why
- **Review Aid**: Helps reviewers understand context and focus areas
- **Project History**: Creates searchable record for future reference
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures all necessary steps are completed

### Key Principles

1. **Clarity**: Write for reviewers who may not have context
2. **Completeness**: Include all necessary information for review
3. **Conciseness**: Be thorough but avoid unnecessary verbosity
4. **Actionability**: Provide clear testing and validation steps

## AI-Generated PR Descriptions

**CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: When generating PR descriptions, you MUST:

1. **ALWAYS REPLACE PLACEHOLDERS**: Never leave placeholder text like "TODO", "FIXME", "Add description here", "<!--comment-->", or generic instructions in brackets
2. **FILL IN ACTUAL CONTENT**: Every section must contain specific, concrete information based on the actual code changes and diffs
3. **BE SPECIFIC ABOUT CHANGES**: List the exact files modified, functions added, and features implemented
4. **NO GENERIC TEXT**: Avoid generic statements like "various improvements" - specify what was improved and how
5. **REMOVE TEMPLATE COMMENTS**: Delete all HTML comments and instructional text from the template
6. **ANALYZE THE DIFFS**: Read through all commit diffs to understand what actually changed
7. **PROVIDE REAL EXAMPLES**: If the template asks for test commands, provide the actual commands that should be run
8. **COMPLETE ALL CHECKLISTS**: Mark checklist items as checked `[x]` only if they were actually completed based on the commits

### What NOT to Do

❌ **NEVER do this:**
```markdown
## Description
<!-- Provide a clear, comprehensive overview of changes -->
Add description here.

## Changes Made
**Core Changes:**
-
-

**Documentation:**
-
```

✅ **ALWAYS do this instead:**
```markdown
## Description
This PR adds draft PR support with `--draft` and `--ready` CLI flags. The default behavior creates draft PRs, but users can override this via command-line flags or the `OMNI_DEV_DEFAULT_DRAFT_PR` configuration setting.

## Changes Made
**Core Changes:**
- Added `--draft` and `--ready` flags to `CreatePrCommand` in `src/cli/git.rs`
- Implemented `should_create_as_draft()` method with priority-based configuration resolution
- Updated `create_github_pr()` to pass `--draft` flag to GitHub CLI when appropriate

**Documentation:**
- Updated help text to document new flags
- Added configuration example to README
```

### AI Generation Checklist

Before returning a PR description, verify:
- [ ] All HTML comments and instructional text removed
- [ ] All placeholder bullet points replaced with actual content
- [ ] All "TODO" and "FIXME" markers removed
- [ ] Specific file names and functions mentioned where relevant
- [ ] Test commands are actual commands, not placeholders
- [ ] Checklist items accurately reflect what was done
- [ ] No sections left empty (either fill them or remove them)
- [ ] Description explains WHAT changed and WHY based on actual commits

## PR Title Guidelines

### Format
Use conventional commit format for consistency:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New features or enhancements
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without functional changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes

### Scope Examples
- `auth`: Authentication systems
- `api`: REST API changes
- `ui`: User interface components
- `cli`: Command-line interface
- `core`: Core application logic
- `docs`: Documentation system

### Title Best Practices

✅ **Good Examples:**
- `feat(auth): implement OAuth2 Google integration`
- `fix(api): resolve rate limiting edge case in user endpoints`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions for macOS`
- `refactor(core): extract common validation logic`

❌ **Avoid:**
- `Update stuff` (too vague)
- `Fix bug` (no context)
- `Add new feature for users` (too verbose)
- `WIP: working on auth` (should not be merged)

## Description Best Practices

### Structure
1. **What**: Clear summary of changes
2. **Why**: Motivation and context
3. **How**: Implementation approach (if complex)
4. **Impact**: User-facing or architectural implications

### Writing Style
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific about changes made
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Link to relevant issues or discussions

### Technical Details
- Include architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Mention performance implications
- Note any breaking changes prominently
- Reference related documentation

## Template Section Guidelines

### Description Section

```

### Checklist Section
**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and completeness

**Guidelines:**
- Only check items that are actually complete
- Add project-specific items as needed
- Use as final quality gate before review
- Don't skip items that don't apply - explain why

### Breaking Changes Section
**Purpose**: Highlight backward compatibility issues

**Guidelines:**
- Only use for actual breaking changes
- Provide clear migration instructions
- Include version information if applicable
- Link to migration guides

**Example:**
```markdown
## Breaking Changes

- All authentication endpoints include rate limiting
- Comprehensive audit logging for security events

## Performance Impact
- Added database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Token validation cached for 5 minutes to reduce provider API calls
- No impact on existing authentication flows

- Token storage supports encryption key rotation for enhanced security
- The system is designed to support enterprise SSO providers in the future

**Documentation:**
- Updated README with OAuth2 setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting guide for common OAuth2 issues
- Created user guide with screenshots for account linking

**Deployment Notes:**
- Requires new environment variables for OAuth2 client credentials
- Database migration will run automatically
- No downtime required for deployment
```

This example demonstrates:
- Clear, specific title following conventional commits
- Comprehensive description with context and impact
- Detailed changes organized by category
